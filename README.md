I ensure my code is functional by testing constantly throughout the development process, and before submission. 

I approach software design by gathering as much information from the client in question, and turning them into requirements that are explicit. Client wants are the highest priority, and once code is created to meet those needs they are tested to ensure they function as intended. 

User needs are incorporated into the program by putting yourself in the shoes of the user and thinking about what features you would need to achieve the goal you had in mind when interacting with the system.
